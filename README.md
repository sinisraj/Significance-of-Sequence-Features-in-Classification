# Significance-of-Sequence-Features-in-Classification

1. Extract features of human and virus protein sequences from interacting and non-interacting protein dataset.
2. Label interacting proteins as '1' and non-intercating proteins as '0'.
3. Merge feature descriptors of both interacting and non-interacting proteins (1's and 0's).
4. With the processed data run the code for PCA, LDA and withoutDR
